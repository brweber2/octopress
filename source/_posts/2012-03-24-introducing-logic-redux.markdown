If you are a professional programmer and you are not familiar with logic programming, then you should add it to your list of things to learn. It should probably be at, or at least very near, the front of the list as well.

One excellent resource to learn Prolog is http://www.learnprolognow.org/.

Logic programming is not great for writing all sorts of general applications, however it is an amazing tool for certain types of problems.

More documentation to follow, but start out with the README file on github and play around with the REPL.  Don't forget about the syntax differences between logic-redux and Prolog proper!
